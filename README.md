# Password Generator

To run this app open clone the project folder and run this command in the terminal: 
>python main.py 


This will ask you questions that will provide you with a password containing letters, numbers and symbols with a randomized outcome. 

This is great for creating passwords that have some form of cryptography to create more secure passwords.
